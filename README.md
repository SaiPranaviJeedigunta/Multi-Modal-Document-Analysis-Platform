# DocFlow: Data-Driven Document Exploration

## Problem Statement
Enterprises rely on vast amounts of publication data across various domains to drive strategic initiatives, inform decision-making, and maintain a competitive edge. However, these valuable insights are often embedded within unstructured data formats, requiring significant manual effort to extract and analyze relevant information. This project addresses the need for an automated solution to ingest, process, and summarize publication data, enabling enterprises to streamline information access, improve operational efficiency, and focus on deriving actionable insights without the burden of sifting through extensive, unstructured content.

## Project Summary
This project automates the data ingestion, storage, and analysis of publications from the CFA Institute Research Foundation. The pipeline utilizes web scraping to extract publication metadata and files, uploads files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), and loads data into Snowflake for structured querying. A FastAPI-based backend is developed to serve summaries of documents, and Streamlit is used for the front end, allowing users to explore and interact with these publications. NVIDIA AI models provide on-the-fly summarization and Q/A capabilities.

## Background
The project focuses on implementing a comprehensive pipeline to automate data ingestion and analysis for CFA Institute publications. The pipeline also includes advanced query and summarization features using state-of-the-art machine learning models. This approach allows users to efficiently search and extract insights from large volumes of textual data.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
The PoC involved creating a minimal version of the pipeline, which included scraping a subset of CFA publications, uploading documents to GCS, and populating Snowflake with metadata. A simple FastAPI service was deployed to test document retrieval and summarization using NVIDIA’s AI models, and a basic Streamlit interface was created for document interaction.

## Project Goals
1. **Automate Data Ingestion**: Set up a pipeline to scrape CFA publications, upload files to GCS, and store metadata in Snowflake.
2. **Develop Backend Services**: Build a FastAPI application to serve data and enable on-the-fly summaries and Q/A using NVIDIA APIs.
3. **Build a User Interface**: Create a Streamlit-based front end to allow users to browse, summarize, and interact with publications.
4. **Implement Search Functionality**: Enable users to query and retrieve relevant information using multi-modal RAG for targeted insights.

## Project Structure
1. **Part 1: Data Ingestion and Database Population**
   - **Data Scraping**: Scrapes titles, images, summaries, and PDF files from CFA publications.
   - **Data Storage**: Uploads images and PDFs to GCS and stores metadata in Snowflake.
   - **Airflow Pipeline**: Automates the data ingestion, uploading, and loading processes.

2. **Part 2: Client-Facing Application (FastAPI + Streamlit)**
   - **FastAPI**:
     - Provides an API to explore documents.
     - Implements on-the-fly summarization using NVIDIA models.
     - Enables Q/A with multi-modal RAG.
   - **Streamlit**:
     - Provides a front-end interface for document browsing and interaction.
     - Supports dropdown and grid selection for easy navigation.

3. **Part 3: Research Notes Indexing and Search**
   - **Incremental Indexing**: Indexes research notes for each document to support targeted searching.
   - **Search Functionality**: Allows users to query research notes and document content based on specific questions.

## Pre-requisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Cloud credentials with permissions for GCS
- NVIDIA API access key
- Snowflake account credentials
- Docker (for containerization and deployment)

## How to Run the Application Locally

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- Configure your `.env` file with the required credentials and configuration values, including Snowflake, GCS, and NVIDIA API keys.

### Step 1: Set Up Dockerized Environment
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Ensure `.env` is correctly set up with environment variables for Snowflake, GCS, NVIDIA API keys, and other necessary credentials.

3. **Start Docker Containers**
   - Build and start the Docker containers, including Airflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit.
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Step 2: Start Airflow (for Data Ingestion)
1. Access Airflow:
   - Once the containers are running, open Airflow's UI by visiting `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Login using the default credentials (`airflow`/`airflow` unless otherwise configured).
   - Ensure Firefox is installed as this selenium scrapper code uses the Firefox browser for scraping.
   - Update configurations and system paths in docker-compose.yml and Dockerfile.
2. Trigger DAG:
   - In the Airflow UI, start the data ingestion DAG to begin scraping publications and uploading images/PDFs to GCS, and populate the Snowflake database.

### Step 3: Start FastAPI and Streamlit Applications
1. **FastAPI**
   - FastAPI will automatically run as a service within Docker. Access it by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to view the API documentation and test endpoints.
2. **Streamlit**
   - Streamlit will also run as a Docker service, accessible at `http://localhost:8501`.
   - Use the Streamlit UI for document selection, summary generation, and Q/A interactions.

### Step 4: Stop the Application
- When you’re done, stop the containers:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
